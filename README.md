**Week 7: Deployment and DevOps for MERN Applications**

**Objective:**

- Apply DevOps practices to deploy and manage a MERN stack application.
- Utilize version control, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud hosting platforms.
- Implement monitoring and logging for application reliability.

**Project Suggestion:** Build and deploy a "Personal Blog Platform" where users can create, edit, and publish blog posts. The goal is to focus on deploying and maintaining the application effectively.

**Instructions:**

1. **Project Setup:**
   - Create a new project folder called `mern-blog-platform`.
   - Ensure the project includes:
     - A backend with Express.js and MongoDB.
     - A frontend built with React.
   
2. **Version Control:**
   - Initialize a Git repository and push code to GitHub.
   - Use feature branches for new functionalities.
   - Document a clear commit history.

3. **Continuous Integration:**
   - Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing on every push.
   - Ensure test cases run before merging changes.
   - Notify contributors of failed builds.

4. **Backend Deployment:**
   - Deploy the backend using Render.
   - Configure environment variables securely.
   - Implement PM2 for process management.

5. **Frontend Deployment:**
   - Deploy the frontend on Vercel.
   - Connect the frontend to the deployed backend API.
   - Ensure responsiveness and performance optimization.

6. **Error Handling and Monitoring:**
   - Integrate a logging tool (e.g., Winston, Morgan) for tracking requests.
   - Implement Sentry for frontend error tracking.
   - Monitor server logs using Render's dashboard.

7. **Security Considerations:**
   - Use HTTPS for secure communication.
   - Store sensitive credentials using environment variables.
   - Implement basic authentication for accessing the admin panel.

8. **Documentation:**
   - Write a `README.md` file that includes:
     - Project overview.
     - Steps to install and deploy the application.
     - Explanation of CI/CD pipeline setup.
     - Monitoring and security measures.

9. **Submission:**
   - Push your code to your GitHub repository.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- Successful deployment of both backend and frontend.
- Proper setup of CI/CD pipelines.
- Effective use of monitoring and logging tools.
- Secure handling of environment variables.
- Clear and structured documentation.
